# Harvard CS50P Python Practice

This repository contains the Python files I am working on as part of completing the Harvard CS50P course. I've set up a directory locally to add commit and push files straight from my terminal in Visual Studio Code

## Purpose
These files serve as a reference for:
- Practicing and applying Python programming concepts.
- A resource to refer back to for fundamental implementations in future projects.
